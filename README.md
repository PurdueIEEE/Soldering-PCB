# Soldering-PCB
a 4-bit adder used as a soldering practice pcb



Changes to be made for v2
- ~~Ensure no vias to different signals close to soldering points (i.e. the one by the 9V lines)~~
- ~~Make 9V holes bigger~~
- ~~Consider making resistor pads a tad larger~~
- ~~Consider making 3V linear regulator pads a tad bigger~~ (decided not to)
- ~~Make the resistors values larger and J1 labels.~~
- ~~Consider adding IEEE or Purdue logo on bottom left silkscreen~~
- ~~Make PCB text header larger~~
- ~~Consider making board smaller (see if it will actually save cost)~~ (didn't do this)
