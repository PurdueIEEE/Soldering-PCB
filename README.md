# Soldering-PCB
a 4-bit adder used as a soldering practice pcb



Changes to be made for v2
- Ensure no vias to different signals close to soldering points (i.e. the one by the 9V lines)
- Make 9V lines bigger
- Make resistor pads a tad larger
- Make 3V linear regulator a tad bigger
- Make lots of the text bigger
